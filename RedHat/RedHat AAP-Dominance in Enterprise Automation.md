## Company Background
RedHat's story begins in 1993 with the merger of two companies:
- ACC Corporation: A catalog business selling Linux and Unix software accessories.
- Red Hat Software: A company founded by Marc Ewing, known for its Linux distribution, "Red Hat Linux."

This merger laid the foundation for RedHat as a prominent player in the open-source software world.
Red Hat leaders apply open source below principles to their management styles.
- Open exchange
- Transparency
- Meritocracy

The Red Hat business model is based on an open source ecosystem, where collaborative development occurs within a community of professionals focused on providing quality assurance, testing and customer support.
- October, 2018, IBM acquired Red Hat for $34 billion. Red Hat became a business unit of IBM's Hybrid Cloud team, while continuing to preserve the independence and neutrality of Red Hat's open source development heritage.
- September 2019, Redhat introduced the new product "Ansible Automation Platform" a new offering that combines the simple and powerful Ansible solutions with new capabilities for cross-team collaboration, governance and analytics, resulting in a platform for building and operating automation at scale. Along with the Automation platform Redhat introduced Ansible Content Collections,Automation Hub and Automation Analytics.

## Industry Background

The network and cloud automation industry has emerged as a critical enabler of digital transformation. As organizations increasingly dependency on complex IT infrastructures, the need for automated solutions to manage and orchestrate these environments has become key requirement. Network automation streamlines network operations, reduces manual errors, and improves agility, while cloud automation optimizes resource allocation, accelerates application deployment, and ease scalability.

Before the dedicated automation and orchestration platforms evolved, organizations used a variety of methods to automate network and cloud tasks, each with its own set of challenges and limitations.

- Manual Processes and Scripting:

1. Manual Configuration: Network devices were often configured manually, a time-consuming and error-prone process.   
2. Custom Scripts: Organizations developed custom scripts using languages like Python or Perl to automate repetitive tasks. However, these scripts were often difficult to maintain, lacked reusability, and required in-depth programming knowledge.   

- Network Management Systems (NMS):

1.  Basic Automation: NMS tools offered limited automation capabilities, such as bulk configuration changes and basic monitoring.
2. Vendor-Specific Solutions: Many NMS tools were vendor-specific, limiting interoperability and flexibility.

- Cloud Provider Tools:

Limited Scope: Cloud providers offered basic tools for managing resources within their respective platforms, but these tools often lacked the flexibility and integration capabilities required for complex automation scenarios.
