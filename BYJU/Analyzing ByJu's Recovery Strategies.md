## Business Model Overview

BYJU’s operates on a freemium business model that combines free content access with premium subscription plans for advanced features. The platform provides K-12 educational content, competitive exam preparation (e.g., JEE, NEET, UPSC), and skill-based courses in collaboration with global institutions. BYJU's app uses video-based, gamified learning and personalized content delivery powered by AI to enhance user engagement.
Revenue primarily comes from subscriptions, which are sold through direct sales channels, including on-ground representatives and online campaigns. BYJU’s also offers one-on-one mentoring services and live tutoring sessions under premium plans. Their offline learning centers complement their digital offerings, expanding their reach.
The company relies on targeted advertising and strategic partnerships to acquire customers, often utilizing India's extensive student population. Acquisitions like Aakash Institute and WhiteHat Jr have diversified its product portfolio. Despite high revenue (~$1.25 billion in FY 2022), BYJU’s faces challenges like high customer acquisition costs and scrutiny over its aggressive marketing practices.
